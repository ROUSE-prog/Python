 Biodiversity in National Parks

Project description
For this project, I interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

- perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of species;
- investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. 

During this project, I analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

Questions to answer:
- What is the distribution of conservation_status for animals?
- What is observation destribution by conservation status?
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
- Which species were spotted the most at each park?
- Finding relationships between categories and their protection status.

Also found some specific types of animals and plants
* Finding sheeps in the data
 - Observations of sheeps by park in a week
* Finding fern in the data
 - Observations of ferns by park in a week
